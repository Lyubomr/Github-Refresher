Starting refresher training on Git use. Keeping notes on my progress in a journal-style way.

Created a local repository using git init. After creating the repo on GitHub.com
I've added a remote host called origin using and SSH key. Then I've pushed to the master branch.
When you write git push origin master you're pushing the code to a remote server called origin onto the default branch called master


Working on cloning repositories. Cloned an old javascript repo into the GitHub repo.

Note that creating another directory is not required when cloning into the home directory. Github will create another directory for you

This is why the repo is within another direction i.e. Javascript_Fundamentals/javascript_fundamentals.
